    "# Priority Queues\n",
    "\n",
    "- A set of elements each with a given **priority**.\n",
    "- One can insert in any order.\n",
    "- Removal is performed following the **priority order** (the element with highest priority is removed first).\n",
    "- The elements are stored according to their priorities, and not to their position (like it was for queues, sequences, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Priority Queue\n",
    "- Queue where we can insert in any order. When we remove an element from the queue, it is always the one with the highest priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Priority Queue ADT\n",
    "- A priority queue stores a collection of entries.\n",
    "- Each **entry* is a pair (key, value) or (key, element).\n",
    "- Keys in a priority queue can be arbitrary objects on which a total order is defined.\n",
    "- Two distinct entries in a priority queue can have the same key.\n",
    "- Main methods of Priority Queue ADT:\n",
    "    - `insert(k, v)`: inserts an entry with key k and value v.\n",
    "    - `removeMin()`: removes and returns the entry with smallest key, or null if the queue is empty.\n",
    "- Additional methods:\n",
    "    - `min()`: returns an entry with smallest key, or null if the queue is empty.\n",
    "    - `size()`, `isEmpty()`\n",

    "### Total Order Relations\n",
    "- Keys in a priority queue can be arbitrary objects on which an order is defined.\n",
    "- Two distinct entries in a priority queue can have the same key.\n",
    "- Mathematical concept of total order relation <=:\n",
    "    - Comparability property: either x <= y or y <= x\n",
    "    - Antisymmetric property: x <= y and y <= x -> x = y\n",
    "    - Transitive property: x <= y and y <= z -> x <= z\n",
    "\n",
    "### Entry ADT\n",
    "- An entry in a priority queue is simply a key-value pair.\n",
    "- Priority queues store entries to allow for efficient insertion and removal based on keys.\n",
    "- Methods:\n",
    "    - `getKey()`: returns the key for this entry.\n",
    "    - `getValue()`: returns the value associated with this entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparator ADT\n",
    "- A comparator encapsulates the action of comparing two objects according to a given total order relation.\n",
    "- A generic priority queue uses an auxiliary comparator.\n",
    "- The comparator is external to the keys being compared.\n",
    "- When the priority queue needs to compare two keys, it uses its comparator.\n",
    "- Primary method of the Comparator ADT:\n",
    "    - `compare(x, y)`: returns an integer i such that i < 0 if x < y, i = 0 if x = y, i > 0 if x > y, and an error if x and y cannot be compared.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation with an Unsorted Sequence\n",
    "- The elements of S are a composition of two elements, k, the key, and e, the element.\n",
    "- `insert()` = `insertLast()` in the sequence; O(1) time\n",
    "- The sequence is not ordered; for `min()` and `removeMin()`, we need to look at all the elements of S; O(n) time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation with Sorted Sequence\n",
    "- Use a Sequence S, sorted by increasing keys.\n",
    "- `min()` and `removeMin()` take O(1) time.\n",
    "- To implement `insertItem()`, we must now scan through the entire sequence in the worst case. This, `insertItem()` runs in O(n) time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### An Application: Sorting\n",
    "- A Priority Queue P can be used for sorting a sequence S by:\n",
    "    - *inserting* the elements of S into P with a series of `insert(e, e)` operations.\n",
    "    - *removing* the elements from P and putting them back into S with a series of `removeMin()` operations.\n",
    "- The running time if this sorting method depends on the priority queue implementation."
