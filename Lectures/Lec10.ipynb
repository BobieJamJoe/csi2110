    "## Map ADT\n",
    "- A MAP is an ADT to efficiently store and retrieve values based on a uniquely identifying **search key**.\n",
    "-  It stores key-value pairs (k, v), which we call **entries**.\n",
    "- Keys are unique. A key is mapped to a value.\n",
    "- The main operations of a MAP are **searching**, **inserting**, and **deleting** items.\n",
    "- Maps are also known as **associated arrays**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MAP ADT Methods\n",
    "- `get(k)`: returns the value v associated to key k, if such entry exists; otherwise returns null.\n",
    "- `put(k, v)`: if M does not have an entry with key k, then adds (k, v) and returns null; otherwise it replaces with v the value of the entry with key equal to k and returns the old value.\n",
    "- `remove(k)`: removes from M the enrty with key k and returns its value; if M has no such entry, then returns null.\n",
    "- `size()`: returns the number of entries in M.\n",
    "- `isEmpty()`: boolean indicating if M is empty.\n",
    "- `keySet()`, `values()`, `entrySet()` returns an iterable collection of keys, values, key-value entries (respectively) stored in M.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sorted MAP ADT Methods\n",
    "- In addition to the MAP methods.\n",
    "- `firstEntry()`, `lastEntry()`: returns the entry with smallest key, alrgest key (respectively), or null if the map is empty.\n",
    "- `subMap(k1, k2)`: returns an iterable list with all the entries greater than or equal to k1, but strictly less than k2.\n",
    "- `lowerEntry(k)`, `higherEntry(k)`, `floorEntry(k)`, `ceilingEntry(k)`: return the entry with, respectively:\n",
    "    - the greatest key < k, the smallest key > k,\n",
