    "- An **algorithm** is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem in a finite amount of time.\n",
    "- Analyze an algorihtm = determine its efficiency.\n",

    "- Running time\n",
    "- Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running Time\n",
    "- The running time of an algorithm typically grows with the input size.\n",
    "- It also depends on the input data; different inputs of the same size can have different running times.\n",
    "- **Average case** time if often difficult to determine.\n",
    "- We focus on the **worst case** running time.\n",
    "    - Easier to analyze.\n",
    "    - Crucial to applications such as games, finance, and robotics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experimental Studies\n",
    "- Write a program implementing the algorithm.\n",
    "- Run the program with inputs of varying size and composition, noting the time needed.\n",
    "- Plot the results.\n",

    "### Limitations of Experiments\n",
    "- It is necessary to implement the algorithm, which may be difficult.\n",
    "- Results may not be indicative of the running time on other inputs not included in the experiment.\n",
    "- In order to compare two algorithms, the same hardware and software environments must be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theoretical Analysis\n",
    "- It is a **general methodology** that:\n",
    "    - Uses a **high-level description** of the algorithm (**pseudo-code**) independent of implementation.\n",
    "    - Characterizes running time as **a function of the input size**.\n",
    "    - Takes into account **all possible inputs**.\n",
    "    - Is **independent of the hardware and software** environment.\n",
