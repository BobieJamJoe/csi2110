All methods are fully implemented and working. 

Implemented a new method "uniqueTester()" to automatically test the runtimes of
unique1() and unique2() and output results to a text file. Modified main()
method to allow running uniqueTester() from main().

test.txt was generated using uniqueTester(). Array size was doubled each
iteration until both algorithms exceeded 60 seconds.
